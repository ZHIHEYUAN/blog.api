<p>Most English people eat four meals a day. They have breakfast at any time from 7:00 to 9:00 in the morning. They usually eat eggs or bread and drink tea or coffee for breakfast. Lunch usually comes at about 1 o'clock. Some of them eat in the restaurant and some of them eat at home. Afternoon tea is from 4:00 to 5:00. Dinner is at about half past seven. In some families, they like eating well in the evening, because they are usually very busy in the day. First they usually have soup, and then they have meat or fish with vegetables for the big meal. After that, they eat some other things like bananas, apples or ice cream.</p>
