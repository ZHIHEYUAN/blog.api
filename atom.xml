<p>Most English people eat four meals a day. They have breakfast at any time from 7:00 to 9:00 in the morning. They usually eat eggs or bread and drink tea or coffee for breakfast. Lunch usually comes at about 1 o'clock. Some of them eat in the restaurant and some of them eat at home. Afternoon tea is from 4:00 to 5:00. Dinner is at about half past seven. In some families, they like eating well in the evening, because they are usually very busy in the day. First they usually have soup, and then they have meat or fish with vegetables for the big meal. After that, they eat some other things like bananas, apples or ice cream.</p>

<p>My name is Gary. Before I was twelve, my family lived in the mountains. Our house was far from my school, and it took me one hour to walk to school every morning. It was a happy time for me because I could meet friends on the way and we would go to school together. There were about ninety students in my school. We spent most of our time playing. The mountains were our playground. I still remember different kinds of trees and flowers in different seasons. Everything was so interesting and beautiful. Even now, I still miss my life in the mountains.</p>

<p>All families are different. Most families are small. But I have a big and happy family—my grandparents, my parents, my uncle, my sister, my little brother and I. My father and my uncle work in the same factory. My mom is a nurse in a hospital. We do many things together. We often take a family trip on weekends. Sometimes, we visit my grandparents in the country. We cook, eat and talk together. I love my family very much.</p>
