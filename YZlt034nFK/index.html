<p>My name is Mike. I took a trip to Dalian with my friends last weekend.</p>
<p>We went there by train. On Saturday morning, we took a walk in a park and we found many beautiful flowers there. In the afternoon, we swam in a pool. The water was very clean. Many people were swimming there because the weather was hot. We went to the movies in the evening and we also ate some delicious food.</p>
<p>On Sunday, it was rainy. We visited a museum there in the morning. There were many beautiful paintings in the museum. In the afternoon, I bought a nice dress for my mother. It was 500 yuan. I think Dalian is very beautiful and the people there are friendly.</p>
