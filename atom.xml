<p>I'm Peter. Fast food used to control my life. I knew it was bad for me. but I still ate it. because it was cheap and delicious. I was getting fatter and fatter. Then I met Sam, a friend I hadn't seen for ten years. He was surprised at the way I looked. We went for lunch together. Sam had salad and I had two hamburgers and a bottle of cola. After lunch we walked to the park. I felt very tired, but he was fine. He told me how he changed his life a few years ago. He used to like fast food too. But then he got a heart disease and needed to change his eating habits. He told me to stop eating fast food and do more exercise. It was hard, but now I never eat fast food and go running in the park every morning.</p>
