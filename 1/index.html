<p>Hi, George! I read a report about wild animals in a magazine yesterday.</p>
<p>What does the report say, Maria?</p>
<p>It says many wild animals are in danger.</p>
<p>Is the magazine's name Nature?</p>
<p>Yes, it is. After I read it, I felt very angry. Some people killed elephants for their ivories.</p>
<p>They are too cruel. In my opinion, people must stop killing animals for money.</p>
<p>I agree with you. People should know “No trading, no killing”.</p>

<p>Hi, Lisa. How was your weekend last week?</p>
<p>Great. Thanks.</p>

<p>I worked as a guide at the Natural History Museum.</p>
<p>Really? How interesting!</p>
<p>Yeah, it was fun. They have a butterfly house with over 200 kinds of butterflies. I told the visitors about them and their living habits. Did you have a good weekend, Paul?</p>

<p>I'm sorry to hear that. You'd better go to bed earlier.</p>
