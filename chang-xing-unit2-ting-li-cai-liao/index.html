<p>Hello, everyone. Here comes the sports news from the No.3 Middle School. The first part is last Tuesday's eighth­grade football games. In the first game, Class 1 won five goals and Class 2 won two goals. In the second game, Class 3 won four goals and Class 4 didn't go at all. Class 4 needed more practice. In the third game, Class 1 won three goals and Class 3 won one goal. Class 1 was the final winner. Congratulations! And now comes the running race news. In the girls' 200­meter race last Friday, everyone thought the winner would be Kate or Lily. But Julia was the dark horse. Last year, Julia only got the sixth place, but this year she got the first place.</p>

<p>Hello, I'm Greg. I used to be thin. Last year I wanted to become strong, so I decided to try running. I trained hard and went running every day. But then there was something wrong with me. My legs and feet hurt so much. After that, I heard about a running group. I decided to join it. Later, I found that I preferred running with a group. It was great fun. Now I've made a lot of friends in the group. We knock around together even when we aren't running.</p>
