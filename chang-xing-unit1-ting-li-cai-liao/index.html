<p>My name is Gary. Before I was twelve, my family lived in the mountains. Our house was far from my school, and it took me one hour to walk to school every morning. It was a happy time for me because I could meet friends on the way and we would go to school together. There were about ninety students in my school. We spent most of our time playing. The mountains were our playground. I still remember different kinds of trees and flowers in different seasons. Everything was so interesting and beautiful. Even now, I still miss my life in the mountains.</p>
